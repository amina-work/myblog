            <p>Throughout my reading, I found myself flipping between giving this book a four or five-star rating. 
                The ending settled that for me. <br /><br />The book was captivating. We first begin with the 
                viewpoint of the twin, walking us through the major disappearing event, the vague details of 
                what followed after in the new city, and then the eventual return to her hometown and mother. 
                And then we move on all the way across to the second generation with the twins daughters, 
                following the outlines of lives also.<br /><br />I think the strongest part of this book are 
                the characters, even with their imperfections they grip you and force you to connect with and 
                thoroughly understand them. Even the villians are still human, and the author makes you 
                uncomfortably aware of that as you try to figure out what they should be facing, whether they are 
                deserving of forgiveness, what they could do to earn it if that's ever a possibility.<br /><br />
                It was frustrating, reaching the ending and understanding that nothing would be resolved that 
                easily. People make their decisions and that's it. However that might affect other would be 
                forever theirs to deal with.<br /><br />A part of me felt dissapointed at Stella for not showing 
                up in the funeral, her leaving without saying goodbye both solidified it and left open the 
                possibility of a different better reunion. But I have the feeling that even if her daughter have 
                informed her in the end, she would not have showed up.<br /><br />Saying this, the story felt 
                somewhat rushed, in the sense that some subject matters were not as explored as they could've 
                been. I felt like I knew so little of what the characters actually went through, Reese's 
                experiences especially and the challenges that he must've of gone through kind of fell away 
                after his backstory was done with. Additionally, I found myself missing Desiree and Early 
                about halfway through the book.<br /><br />We never really find out how their relationship 
                progressed after the initial introduction, excited as I was to read more about them. By the 
                end, they feel less like characters we know and more like parents who lived different lives 
                that we can never really imagine or hope to understand as clearly as our own. And it makes 
                sense in a way, because we were looking at them from Jude's view at that point.<br /><br />
                Overall, this was a great book. It involved some very interesting characters that I know that 
                I know will stick with me for a while. The weaving of storylines and lifetimes was done so well 
                and with such coherence that it enhanced the story and my experience. This was my first book by 
                the author, and I look forward to learning more of her work.</p>
